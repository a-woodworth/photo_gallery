# Photo Gallery Project

Create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery from design files. Finished project should have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. Also, when the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo should display in a lightbox with back and previous buttons to cycle through photos.
